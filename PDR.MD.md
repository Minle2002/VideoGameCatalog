# Video Game Catalog PRD

## Problem & Goal

The video game industry has become the largest entertainment industry in the world with dozens of platforms and thousands of game releases each year.  The sheer breadth of game releases makes it difficult for hobbyists to keep track of both released and upcoming games on a singular platform. This app will alleviate this issue by allowing these individuals to select the games they currently own as well as the games that are yet to be released, regardless of platform preferences.

## Proposal

This application is designed for games in mind, especially those that play on more than one platform. The app will allow players to view games that have been released and those that are upcoming. These games will each have a separate page with various information; including but not limited to general information, reviews, images, and users’ thoughts on a game. All of the games will be allowed to be placed into one of four categories; including “Currently Playing”, ‘Completed”, “Backlog”, and “Wishlist”. The application will work much like “Goodreads” but for video games.

Games general information:

- Release Date
- Platforms
- Developers
- Publishers

Definitions:

Currently Playing: A game the user has started but has not yet completed

Completed: A game the user has finished and is no longer playing

Backlog: A game the user has bought but has yet to start playing

Wishlist: A game the user has not purchased but would like to purchase in the future. This may include both released and non-released games.

## Plan

The initial stages of the product development will include brainstorming and the initial design of the app for the best user experience. The app will then go through prototype development to test the main features while allowing for a more tangible idea of the design, it will not have full functionality during this stage of development. Then it will go through a series of tests for future improvements.  Finally, the app will go through final development to ensure all aspects are working as intended before the final release in Spring 2024.
